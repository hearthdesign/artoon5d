## Colors and Typography

The color palette of Artoon5D Blog consists of pastel and vibrant tones, carefully selected to create a friendly and playful atmosphere. These colors are limited in number to ensure visual consistency and are associated with a family- and kids-friendly design, enhancing readability and creating an inviting experience for all visitors.

The typography complements this approach with Comic Sans MS, using uppercase headings for emphasis and a light, approachable style for body text and lists.

## Testing

This project includes a small but reliable test suite designed to validate core functionality and prevent regressions while keeping maintenance overhead low.
The testing strategy intentionally combines Django’s built-in test framework and pytest, each used where it is most effective.

### Errors and fixes applied during development:

Resolved “Cannot read properties of null” errors in JavaScript by ensuring elements exist before applying scroll or carousel behaviors.
Fixed double-submission of forms (like post deletion) by disabling buttons upon click.
Corrected scroll-to-top button visibility issues by moving the button to the base template and using a safe DOMContentLoaded listener.
Improved image loading performance by adding Cloudinary optimizations and lazy loading.
These fixes and optimizations help the blog run smoothly for both small and growing audiences while maintaining an engaging, family-friendly experience

## Deployment & Environment Setup

This project is designed to be deployed using modern cloud services while remaining fully runnable locally.

The production setup uses:
 - Cloudinary for media storage
 - NeonDB (PostgreSQL) for the database
 - Heroku for application hosting

### Local Development Setup
Clone the repository
git clone https://[https://github.com/hearthdesign/artoon5d]
cd your-repo

### Create and activate a virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  
# Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
#### Install dependencies
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Environment Variables

Create a .env file at project root:
```
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key

DATABASE_URL=postgres://...

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

⚠️ .env is excluded from version control and must never be committed.

### Cloudinary Setup

Create an account at https://cloudinary.com
Create a new cloud
Copy credentials into .env
Install Cloudinary support:
pip install django-cloudinary-storage


### Configure settings.py:
```
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```

### Database (NeonDB)

- Create a PostgreSQL database at https://neon.tech

- Copy the connection string

- Set DATABASE_URL in .env

- Run migrations:

```python manage.py migrate```

### Heroku Deployment
- Create Heroku app
- heroku create your-app-name

- Add required buildpacks
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/python

Set environment variables
```
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=...
heroku config:set CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...
heroku config:set DATABASE_URL=...
```
- Deploy
```git push heroku main```

- Run migrations
```heroku run python manage.py migrate```

Static & Media Handling
Static files served via Whitenoise
Media files served via Cloudinary
No local media storage in production

### Production Checklist

✔️ DEBUG disabled
✔️ Secret key secured
✔️ Database externalized
✔️ Media storage offloaded
✔️ Caching enabled where safe

## Scalability and Future Improvements
The Artoon2D Blog has been designed with scalability in mind, using Django’s modular architecture, reusable components, and a clear separation of concerns between models, views, templates, and static assets. This allows the project to grow in features and traffic without major restructuring.

Planned improvements include:

 - Pagination and infinite scroll for posts to handle larger content volumes.
 - Enhanced search and filter capabilities, such as tag-based search or advanced category filtering.
 - Accessibility enhancements, including better keyboard navigation and ARIA labels.
 - Responsive optimizations for very small or very large screens.
 - Optional integration with additional social sharing platforms and analytics tools.
